							<p><strong>What I am passionate about.</strong> I have a natural curiosity of how different job roles and areas work 
								 together from back and middle office to the field. My career has taken me through
								different refinery technologies as both a team lead and individual to an analyst
								 with the commercial trading group. In each role I have been able to improve my
								  soft skills like  working through others to gain alignment as well as
								   hard skills like marginal analysis with LP optimization planning runs.
									 I enjoy working through challenges that provide that opportunity
									  to learn or teach and show  how I can impact the bottom line.</p>

										<p>Assigned to commercial trading group. Assessed crude and product price differentials relative to market pricing using the LP. Developed crude pecking order lists with most profitable crudes for three month and yearly budget. Identified decision points on price and utilization changes that might affect the order on a weekly basis and reported these to senior leadership in the commercial trading group. Developed optimized start up plans that transitioned to on stream running. Reviewed LP configuration for opportunities on crude composition, blending capability, etc. to improve profitability. Analyzed ongoing analysis of unit margins for both running and potential unit technologies like Isomerization.</p>
										<ul class="feature-icons">
											<li >Identified issues and improved the accuracy of gasoline blending by improving the distillation, T50 and vapor to liquid ratio calculations. This allowed more profitable grades to be produced worth $50,000/day with no capital cost.</li>
											<li>Modified the LP to include resid and atmospheric column resid production to match the refinery operator blending capability worth $40,000/day.</li>
											<li>Used python to group data and show that historical pricing was not correlated with crude market pricing and improved pricing from the marketing group by $0.50/bbl on 5 target crude groups</li>
											<li>Automated crude composition imports to the LP from a PDF.</li>
											<li>Increased LP optimization speed by 10X by using a cloud server that could also be used for future AI/ML projects.</li>
											<li>Reduced opportunity crude decisions to under an hour.</li>
											<li>Pricing and option data like volatility was used to develop a model that shows the current expected market movement and provide optimization target ranges and reduced risk to the refinery margin when not operating at the current conditions.</li>
											<li>Scenario optimization led to specific crudes and products to be bought and sold. This improved refinery stability and maximized profitability worth ($75,000/day) $0.75/bbl. </li>
